Problem Statement:
Managing task-based activist communities on WhatsApp while tracking participation and verifying proof of completed tasks is not only inefficient â€” it's humanly unsustainable at scale.

WhatsApp-Based Workflow (Before the Tool):
1_User fills out a Google Form
2_Enters a gender-specific "Entry Gate" WhatsApp group
3_Admins monitor for task completion updates
4_Those who report "completed" are manually promoted to the "Active Participants" group
5_Admins continue tracking "Active Participants" group to ensure consistent engagement

Pain Points:
1_Excessive manual workload for admins
2_Voice-based gender verification created chaos and delays
3_Admins had to save every phone number to add users to groups
4_Risk of misgendered placement in private groups
5_Difficult to monitor group conversations
6_Individual tracking of participant progress was error-prone
7_No central dashboard for task proof verification and promotion
